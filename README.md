# Starter-Kit

So I built this for and developer who wants to start creating a website. My Goal is to save you time of spending hours looking for ways to speed up your learning. Sometimes all we want to do is just code.

I broke it down in simple steps to get you going.

## Steps


 **Install all the node packages** 
On the root of this project run on your terminal
```bash
    sudo npm install har-validator@latest --save-dev
    sudo npm install
    sudo npm install gulp -g 
    sudo npm install webpack -g
    sudo npm install webpack-cli -g
```

**Start the dev server**
```bash
  npm run watch
```

**Start the dev server with proxy**
```bash
  npm run proxy
```

**Build files for production**
```bash
  npm run build
```
